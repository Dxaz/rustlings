# My Rustlings ๐ฆ

**Rustlings** provides a collection of small, guided exercises designed to help you get hands-on experience reading and writing Rust codeโand learn how to respond to compiler messages.

## Purpose

* Reinforce concepts from "The Book" through practical, hands-on challenges.
* Enhances my debugging skills by fixing compiler errors directly.

---

## Prerequisites โ

* `rustup` & `cargo`.
---

## Installation ๐ฆ

```bash
cargo install rustlings
```

```bash
rustlings init
```

---

## Using Rustlings โ๏ธ

### Watch Mode (recommended) ๐

```bash
rustlings
```


### Verify Once 1๏ธโฃ

* To check all exercises without watch-mode:

```bash
rustlings check-all
```

* To run a specific exercise:

```bash
rustlings run <exercise_name>
```

* Manually get hints:

```bash
rustlings hint <exercise_name>
```
